# Retrospective

## Discuss a part of your project that has not been as successful as you would have liked, and how it can be improved in this iteration

One aspect of the project that has not been as successful as we would have liked is our code review process and the overall code quality. In the previous iteration, we received numerous reports of code smells from the markers, highlighting areas that needed improvement. To address this, we have decided to adopt a collaborative and team-driven approach to our code reviews.

In this iteration, we are conducting more thorough smell tests as a team, actively involving all team members to provide their insights and observations during the code review process. This approach allows us to gain multiple perspectives on the codebase and identify potential issues early on. By doing so, we aim to reduce the number of code smell reports significantly compared to the previous iteration, and improving the overall code quality.

## Determine concrete (and realistic) ways of improvement, and decide how its success will be evaluated at the end of the iteration (measurable and objective)

Another area that requires improvement is the planning phase of our development process. In the past, insufficient planning has led to situations where code required multiple adjustments and refactoring, resulting in technical debt and wasted developer time.

To address this issue, we are now prioritizing the planning/design phase of each feature implementation. We conduct in-depth discussions as a team to thoroughly evaluate design choices, consider potential challenges, and anticipate future requirements, ensuring compliance with SOLID Principles. By doing so, we aim to minimize technical debt and the need for extensive refactoring during the development process.

## Evaluating Success

The success of these improvements will be evaluated based on measurable outcomes. For the code review process and code quality, we will track the reduction in code smell reports compared to the previous iteration. Our goal is to achieve a substantial decrease in identified issues, indicating an improvement in code quality.

Regarding the planning and technical debt, success will be determined by observing a significant reduction in technical debt during this iteration. We aim for a smoother development process with fewer adjustments required, as a result of careful planning and design discussions.

## Velocity

As seen in the chart found at: [Velocity.png](.\docs\Velocity.png), we have noticed that our estimated work was higher than the completed work in the first Iteration. We attribute this shallow understanding of how much work was required for the features we didn't finish in iteration 1. However, we have made notable improvements in our time estimations compared to the first iteration having finished all committed work in iteration 2 without having too little work or overworking. We will continue to monitor and refine our velocity estimates to ensure continued accurate planning and better developer task delegations.
